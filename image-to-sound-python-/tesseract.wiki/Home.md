# Tesseract at UB Mannheim

The Mannheim University Library (UB Mannheim) uses Tesseract to perform OCR (optical character recognition)
of historical German newspapers ([Allgemeine Preußische Staatszeitung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allgemeine_Preu%C3%9Fische_Staatszeitung), [Deutscher Reichsanzeiger](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Reichsanzeiger)). The latest results with OCR from more than 360,000 scans are available [online](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/periodika/en/imperial-gazette/ocr/).

## Tesseract installer for Windows

Normally we run Tesseract on Debian GNU Linux, but there was also the need for
a Windows version. That's why we have built a Tesseract installer for Windows.

**WARNING: Tesseract should be either installed in the directory which is suggested during the installation or in a new directory. The uninstaller removes the whole installation directory. If you installed Tesseract in an existing directory, that directory will be removed with all its subdirectories and files.**

The latest installers can be downloaded here:
* [tesseract-ocr-w32-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20210811.exe](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w32-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20210811.exe) (32 bit) and
* [tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20210811.exe](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20210811.exe) (64 bit) resp.

We don't provide an installer for Tesseract 4.1.0 because we think that the latest version 5.0.0-alpha is better for most Windows users in many aspects (functionality, speed, stability). Version 4.1 is only needed for people who develop software based on the Tesseract API and who need 100 % API compatibility with version 4.0.

There are also [older versions](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/) available.

In addition, we also provide [documentation](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/doc/) which was generated by Doxygen.

## Tesseract models for historic prints

Historic books printed in Fraktur script are supported by the standard models _frk_ and _script/Fraktur_.
In addition we [trained our own models](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesstrain/wiki/GT4HistOCR) on a wide range of historic books. They are available [online](https://ub-backup.bib.uni-mannheim.de/~stweil/tesstrain/). In many cases the results from those models (_Fraktur_5000000_, _frak2021_) are better than those from the standard models.

Hint: Old versions of the installer had an option to add Tesseract to the PATH environment variable. That option was disabled by default. If it was enabled and PATH was very long, it could happen that the new PATH was empty. We suggest not to use that option and disabled it in our latest version.
